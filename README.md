# weather-dashboard

##Purpose
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Built With
HTML, JS

## Website
https://cannibalclarence.github.io/weather-dashboard/

## Overview
This is a weather dashboard that will allow a user to search for a city and display the weather results.

The weather is displayed using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The user's search history is displayed in the left column. The current weather will be displayed at the top right section and the 5-day forecast will display below current.

The current weather data includes an icon, current temp, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The UV index will change color based on low-severe conditions.

The 5-day forecast includes the date, icon, daily temp, and humidity.

The last searched city will be saved in local storage. The next time the user opens the weather dashboard, their last searched city will display with current weather information.

If the API call is not successful, an error message will be displayed telling the user to try searching again with a valid city, and the button with the city name will be removed.
